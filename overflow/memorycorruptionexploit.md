# A Program in Memory

The shown below table is a dumb down version on how a program looks like in the memory.

        | Low memory    |
        | ------------- |
        | Test          |
        | col 2 is      |
        | Data          |
        | Heap          |
        | 1             |
        | v             |
        | Unused Memory |
        | A             |
        | 1             |
        | stack         |
        | High Memory   |

we will work stack overflow exploit development in this particular markdown.

# x86 General Purpose Registers

    ● EIP – The instruction pointer[important]
    ● ESP – stack pointer[important]
    ● EBP – base pointer[important]
    ● ESI – source index
    ● EDI – destination index
    ● EAX – accumulator
    ● EBX – base
    ● ECX – counter
    ● EDX – data.

Register is a the places where programs are stored.

# Vulnerable Code

---

    include <string.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    void overflowed() {
    printf("%s\n", "Execution Hijacked");
    }
    void function1(char *str){
    char buffer[5];
    strcpy(buffer, str);
    }
    void main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
    function1(argv[1]);
    printf("%s\n", "Executed normally");
    }___

# Vulnerability

    ● Strcpy does not bounds checking.
    ● Our program uses Strcpy to copy user input into a fixed
    sized variable.
    ● If we give it more data than the variable can hold, the
    copying will continue.
